# Death-Row
An analysis of Texas inmates last words. Initially was an assignment for a class in data engineering.

Run deathrowinfo.py to scrape the data from the website. This is written to "Death Row Data" Excel file.
Run DeathRowAnalysis in R to perform LSA and KMeans clustering on the resultant Excel file.
