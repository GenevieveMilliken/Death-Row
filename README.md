# Death-Row
An analysis of Texas inmates last words. I wrote this code to use in an assignment in data engineering.

To run this code:
- Run ```python3 deathrowinfo.py``` to scrape the data from the website. This is written to "Death Row Data" Excel file. 
- Run DeathRowAnalysis.R in R to perform LSA and KMeans clustering on the resultant Excel file.
